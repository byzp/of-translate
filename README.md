# how to use

- Download [net.proto](https://github.com/byzp/of-ps/blob/main/proto/net.proto) and [msd_id.py](https://github.com/byzp/of-ps/blob/main/network/msg_id.py), compile proto, then fill in your own API key in sp.py, and then run

- You can also directly use the packaged version of releases (including my private key, please do not abuse it)
